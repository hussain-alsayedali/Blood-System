# How to start :

there is an example of env in the server/config , add the needed information and rename the file to .env .

Email is the sender email

EMAIL_PASSWORD is the password for the given email(gmail is the provider for the current project).

DATABASE_URL is the link to the database

and finally the PORT.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, BCrypt, Passport.js

In the creation of Blood Wave, we employed a stack of technologies that harmonize to deliver both performance and user-friendly experience. The front end was created using React and CSS for an engaging user interface, while JavaScript was utilized to add interactivity and dynamic content.

For the backend, Node.js and Express.js were chosen for their efficiency and lightweight nature, providing a fast and scalable server environment. User authentication is handled securely with Passport.js, with passwords being hashed using BCrypt to ensure user data protection.

The database choice of PostgreSQL offers robustness and reliability, with Prisma ORM simplifying database queries and schema management, making the data handling more efficient and less prone to errors.

By integrating these technologies, Blood Wave provides a seamless and secure platform for managing blood donations.

## Lessons Learned:

The development of Blood Wave was a significant learning experience. It reinforced my understanding of full-stack development and enhanced our skills in both front-end and back-end programming. Utilizing the architecture, we learned how to efficiently structure files and facilitate communication between the server, database, and client.
The project also underscored the importance of user data security, driving home the necessity of implementing robust authentication and encryption practices. Overall, Blood Wave has been instrumental in advancing our capabilities as developers and in understanding the critical aspects of building a secure and comprehensive web application.
